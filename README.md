# ðŸ§  A Comparison of Machine Learning Object Classification Approaches

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project evaluates and compares three distinct machine learning approaches for **image classification** using the **Caltech-256 dataset**. The models tested are:

- âœ… **EfficientNet-B0 (CNN)**  
- âœ… **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with **Bag of Features** and **SURF/SIFT descriptors**  
- âœ… **Bernoulli Naive Bayes** on simplified pixel/feature representations

> Conducted as part of a group assignment for a university course on applied machine learning.

## ðŸ§  Models Compared

| Model                   | Technique                         | Feature Type          | Accuracy | Pros                        | Cons                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|----------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **EfficientNet-B0**    | CNN (Transfer Learning)           | Full Image (Tensor)    | High     | Powerful, automated feature learning | Requires GPU, longer training |
| **SVM + SURF/SIFT**    | Traditional CV + Bag of Features  | Keypoint descriptors   | Medium   | Interpretability, compact   | Requires tuning, not end-to-end |
| **Bernoulli NB**       | Statistical Classifier             | Binary input features  | Low      | Fast, simple                | Low performance, crude features |
